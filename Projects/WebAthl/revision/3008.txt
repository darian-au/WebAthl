Build	3008
Release	309

	changes are:

	- Bug Fix 1:
		- Reporting error on some participants not showing all participant history
		- this was datatype casting problem
		- you may have noticed that the report would have said "data truncated"
		  before, this is where the report fell over and stopped printing the
		  rest of the page.

	- Bug Fix 2:
		- NetPerf calculation, rounding errors:
			- dropping seconds.decimals, this was a rounding error on long
			  distance events, previusly we never noticed it because we
			  never recorded decimals on long distance results

			- dropping minutes, we originally said that sprint events would not
			  need to handle hours or minutes, so it just used the seconds value

		- both sprint and long distance events now use the same calulation for
		  net performance.

	- Processing -> Calculate Over All Place
		- removed Stored Procedure and replaced with SQL.

	- NOTE :
		- you need to run Create SP to fix the 2nd bug.
		- you can try and run just the 
		  "Calculate Net-Performance; Percentile; World-Standard; Points"
		  Process to fix the results in the database, by resetting the next
		  event for processing, but I am not sure what effects this will have
		  on anything else, (I think it should be ok though)
