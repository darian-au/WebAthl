Release	291

	changes are:

	- Club Records
		- instead of storing Open Category AgeGroup as Age,
		  now stores AgeGroup as 0, this way calcRecords groups all opens as 0.
		- removed agecategory.
		- check box allows selection of agegroup.

	- Financial History / Participant History
		- now allows column selection and sort order.

	- Edit Series
		- Handicap / Age Category removed.

	- Person Details
		- select box for registration Type.
		- extra column to display registration period.


	NB: Club Records Open Category stored as 0 will only effect new results.
	all old historical result will still be as they were (until I get
	the reCalc AgeGroups utility working).
