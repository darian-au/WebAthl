Build	1955
Release	219

	changes are:

	all changes discussed have been implemented:

		- Database modification on table EventType
		- Event Types : 2 sprint
				1 long distance
				0 jump / throw

		- Processing based on event type ( as discussed )
				Event Rate
				NetPerformance
				World Standard
				Overall Place
				Consistency Rate
				Club Records

	I have done very little testing on these changes.  They work but I am 
	not completely sure if they compute correct values (althogh they look ok).

	to use the new DLL:
		because of the database change, new tables must be generated, to do this:

		- Perform a Backup using the Old DLL.
		- replace the DLL.
		- Perform a Restore using the New DLL.


	To replace the DLL:

		- log on to the server
		- go to Control Panel -> services
		- scroll down to "World Wide Web Publishing Service"
		- Press the "Stop" button, wait for it to stop
		- Press the "Start" button, wait for it to start

		- the DLL will now be unloaded from memory

		- you can now go the the dir its in ( Inetpub\scripts\actvac )
		- rename webAthl.DLL to webAthl.old.DLL
		- rename webAthl1955.DLL to webAthl.DLL

		- done.
		- don't forget to Restore the DB so that the new Tables are generated.
