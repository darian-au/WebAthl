Build	4500 
Release	390 

	changes are:

	- Split Process "Set Consistency Rates" into two:
		- 1. "Set Consistency Events Rate"
			- Sort on Event Rate ASC (as previously)

		- 2. "Set Consistency Age Standard"
			- Sort on World Standard DESC

	- Series -> Maintain Series -> Rules
		- Change "Events Missed" to "Events Completed" (to accord with algorithm)

		- This is also a change to the data in the RuleSubType table.

			update rulesubtype 
			set rulesubtypedescription = 'Events Completed'
			where rulesubtypedescription = 'Events Missed'

			- I have done this.

	- Reports -> Rules
		- Below Eligibility Rules add statement
		  * Guide only – your Event Manager can advise on your circumstances. 

		- I can't do this on this page as it is generated from the database.
		  It doesn't actually "know" how to distinguish between rules,
		  only that there is a list of rules in the database it has to 
		  loop through to display.
