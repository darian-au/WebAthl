	changes are:

	- Maintenance -> Import Data, doesn't Drop/Create tables any more,
		- You must do it manually if you are loading data.
		- Added warning message also.
		- Works beautifully with ACCESS.

	- New Report -> AgeGroup Ranking

		- Use a Map structure with a Hashing algorithm to remove the
		  duplicate names.

		- Check to make sure it works properly.

		- This is a no frills version, pick the column names you want
		  on the report, (or pick the column names you want check boxes for).

		- Below is my SQL:, you can pick any columns from these tables:
			- Series 
			- Location 
			- EventType 
			- Results 
			- Person 
			- Event 

SELECT 	Series.* , 
	Location.* , 
	EventType.* , 
	Results.* , 
	Person.* , 
	Event.* 

FROM	Series , 
	Location , 
	EventType , 
	Results , 
	Person , 
	Event 

WHERE 	Results.SeriesID = Series.SeriesID 
AND 	Person.PersonID = Results.PersonID 
AND 	Event.EventID = Results.EventID 
AND 	Event.SeriesID = Results.SeriesID 
AND 	Event.SeriesID = Series.SeriesID 
AND 	Event.EventTypeID = EventType.EventTypeID 
AND 	Event.LocationID = Location.LocationID 
AND 	Series.SeriesID = %s 
AND 	Location.LocationID = %s 
AND 	EventType.EventTypeID = %s

ORDER BY 
	Person.Sex , 
	Results.AgeGroup , 
	Results.NetPerformanceHOUR , 
	Results.NetPerformanceMIN , 
	Results.NetPerformanceSEC
