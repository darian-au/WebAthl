Build	2826
Release	294

	changes are:

	- Awards Report,
		- filters on 'Events for Season' for both types of report

	- SetEligibityXmore ("Update Eligibility for the Series") process
		- is now the first process to run outside of a stored procedure
		- (this means it also works under MS-ACCESS)
		- runs very quickly
		- please test it very thoroughly

	- ReSetEligibility "Reset Eligibility for the Series" AND
	- RebuildParticipantForSeries "Rebuild Participants for the Series"
		- have also been modified, but is still in a SP
		- these will be easy to move out, and i will work on doing them next

	- for now though you should have less problems processing.


	NB: need to run Maintenance->CreateSP for new StoredProcedures
