Release	305

	changes are:

	- Edit/Add Person now allows and stores nulls 
	  (a 0 (or any non numeric) in the day, month, 
	  or year box gets turned into a null ).

	- AgeGroup calculations on null fields end up 
	  as null (nulls aren't ignored).

	- implications are that you can no longer search by
	  agegroup in results or club records,
	- actually, you may have problems generating club records 
	  because EventRecord Table has Agegroup in the Primary Key,
	  and doesn't allow nulls.!!

	- maybe a better solution is, if the dob is null, set the
	  AgeGroup to 0 (Open age category).

	- let me know how you go.
