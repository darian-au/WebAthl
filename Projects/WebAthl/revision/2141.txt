	changes are:


>Need the ability to set eligibility on results to Y for series that
>calculate points but have no eligibility criteria (anyone who enters is
>eligible for points.   At the moment we default new starters to X.   We need
>to be able edit this to Y and then re-do postEventProcessing.

	- Utilities->Change Group form, now allows Eligibility to be changed
		( it changes both Results and ParticipantForSeries)

	- When Processing is run, all SP processes now check the number of Eligibility Rules when
		automatically adding a new person into the ParticipantForSeries.
		- If there is less than 1 (ie 0) Eligibility Rules, then the default Eligibility
			is set to 'Y'
		- If there is 1 or more Eligibility Rules, then the default Eligibility is set
			to 'X' (as usual)

To enable these changes you must run CreateSP in maintenance menu on both ACTVAC and ACTCCC db's.
