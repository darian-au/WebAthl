	changes are:

	- I didn't like having the organisation joined directly to financial
		- because the organisation a person ran for during an event should
		  be part of the results history.
		  What happens if a person changes to another Organisation?
		  The event he ran before - he ran for the old organisation
		  And then any new events he runs in will be for the new Organisation.

	- So what I have done is:

		- new Column OrgID on Results Table.
			- to keep history of organisation for each persons event.
		- new Post-Event Process - SetOrganisation
			- looks up current financial and sets the Results.OrgID to the
			  current finacial org for each person.
		

	- As a database change had to be made on the Results Table (added Column OrgID)
		- you now must do a backup / restore.
		- need to edit the Results.CSV file and just add an empty column to the end, as
		  the Results table allows NULLs in OrgID.

		 

	so:

		- Backup both ACTVAC ACTCCC with old webAthl.DLL
		- open the Results.CSV in Excel
		- put a space in the last column so that when you save it
		  it puts a comma at the end of every row.
		- Restore

	- NOTE: now that OrgID is part of the Results History,
		Reports->Results will not show the Organisation unless it has benn processed.
		(ie Process->SetOrganisation for an Event)
		(unless you manually put OrgID in the Results.CSV instead of spaces
		 before you restore)
