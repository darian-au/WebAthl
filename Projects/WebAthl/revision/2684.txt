Release	284

	changes are:

	- addFinancial,
		- wasn't autoselecting the person's - maillist; regtype; org
		  if they were a renewal.

		- it now looks at their most recent financial and autoselects these.
		- if they are new then the defaults are selected.

		- note that because a renewal already has a previous regTypeId
		  it can autoselect the FinancialYearValid based on that regTypeId
		  e.g. say regTypeMonthStart = 7, regTypeMonthStop = 6;
			   then because ((Stop - Start) < 0) and (today.Month <= Stop)
				-> FinancialYearValid autoselects to today.Year -1
					i.e. Today's Financial Year based on the person's
						registrationType

		- if the person is a new memeber (never been financial) then
		  because they have no previous regTypeId the FinancialYearValid
		  cannot be determined. so today.Year is set as the default.
