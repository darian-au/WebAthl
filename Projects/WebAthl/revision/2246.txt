Release	250

	changes are:

	- updated Current function (checks to see if a membership is current)
		- life members must now work differently,
			cannot set the year to a year in the future, this will no
			longer work, (you will get a membership lapsed message)
		
		- now looks at a special case in the RegistrationType
			if you create a new RegistrationType
			and NOT set any month range (leave them both blank)
			this will trigger a special case in the Current function
			which will be the LIFE member case, the year will not be
			checked and this member will always be current.

		- you will need to add a Life-Member RegistrationType
		- for all your life-members you will have to change them over to
		  this new type, if you don't, they will become Lapsed Members.

		- NB you can add different types of life members if you like 
		  e.g. life-member-club; life-member-individual; 
		  life-member-family; etc as long as they have empty month ranges.
