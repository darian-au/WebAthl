Release	316

	changes are:

	- Processing -> "Rebuild Club Records for the Series "
		- removed Stored Procedure and replaced with SQL.

		- I don't know if you noticed but if a Series had 
		  Jump Throw / Sprint / Long Distance all in the same
		  Series, it would calculate the Record by using the first
		  Event it found and then taking the Timed attribute from 
		  that event, then all other events in the Series to calculate
		  the record would be based on that Timed attribute.

		  ie (I didn't check) in Track & Field Series, either all the 
		  Sprints would have been the slowest, OR all the jump/throws would
		  have been shortest! (but not both, one would be right)

		- Anyway, I now do 3 passes for each Type.

		- Also, the old SP wasn't clearing out the EventRecord Table
		  properly, and leaving old data in it.

		  eg if someone had their agegroup fixed up and they had a record
		  at their old agegroup then they would end up in there twice,
		  one for each agegroup.

		- so when you test it, expect to see less records than previously.
