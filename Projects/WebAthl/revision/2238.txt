Release	248

	changes are:

	- new RegistrationType Table

		- you must create a new Security Table : RegistrationType
		- then allocate this Table to a Security Group
		- this will allow privilidged users to access the new Registration Type Menu
		- from here you can add Registration Types and valid month ranges

		- the financial table had to be modified, the column:
			- RegistrationSeason char(1)
		- is now:
			- RegistrationSeason int
		- which is a look-up into the RegistrationType Table
		- so that means all the old data will be invalid, ie we had 'Y' for
			year-long; 'S' for summer etc

		- to fix this you must:

			0. ensure all user access is disabled

			1. backup both ACTVAC & ACTCCC DBs with old DLL.
			2. zip up the csv's so you have a backup
			3. manually modify the CSV for Financial table
			4. change all 'Y' to 1; 'S' to 2 'W' to 3 etc.
			5. save the CSV
			6. replace the DLL
			7. do a restore
			8. go to RegistrationType menu
			9. Add 3 RegistrationTypes
			10. make sure that the RegistrationType ID corresponds to the right
			    type; i.e. if you change the CSVs 'Y' to 1; make sure
			    that the RegistrationType ID for Year-long is 1
			11. check that it worked by going to the finacial for a person
			    and seeing if they have the correct  RegistrationType
			12. also check by running a Finacial History report and a 
			    Person Details report
			13. don't forget to add a security table: RegistrationType
