Release	242

	changes are:

	- Fixed PointScore Anomaly:

		- We were compensating for the situation of 'same performance' by adding
		  a point to the already decremented running points.
		- We were compensating for the situation of 'same place' by adding
		  a point to the already decremented running points.

		- We were NOT compensating for the situation of 'same performance 
		  AND same place' this is why the the points went up because both
		  situations were being compensated for seperately.
		- The fix was just to look out for the situation, and only increment once.

	- You will need to create SP on both ACTVAC and ACTCCC db's to implement the changes.
