Build	2500
Release	273

	changes are:

	- Reports->Results, 
		- Default Column Selections:
			- Place, PersonID, FirstName, LastName
		- ChestNo Added, fixed up Group Start Time

	- Results Entry->Delete relabelled 'bulk Delete Results'
		- confirmation page added

	- Utilities->Delete Results
		- confirmation page added

	- Utilities->Bulk Adjust Groups, 0.9 was truncating to 0 rather than
		rounding off to 1.  modified so now rounds rather than truncates
		- as we have a minimum adjustment factor of 0.55 no-one will ever
			get bulk adjusted to 0. i.e. round(1 x 0.55) = 1.
		- "Bulk Adjustment" message now set when current message is null

		- n.b. bulk adjust utility is alot slower due to these changes.
