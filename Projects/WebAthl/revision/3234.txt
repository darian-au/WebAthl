Release	324

	changes are:

	- Rules -> "General Eligibility" rules, renamed to "Processing" rules.

		- you will need to run the following SQL before using the rules,
		  otherwise, you will loose the "General Eligibility" rules and have to
		  re create them.

UPDATE 	RuleType
SET	RuleTypeDescription = 'Processing'
WHERE	RuleTypeDescription = 'General Eligibility'

	- Rules -> new "Processing" rule added: "Set Overall-Place By Division"

		- after running the above SQL, go to 
		  Series -> Rules -> "set Rule Types" to create the new rule

	- Processing -> uses new "Processing" rule "Set Overall-Place By Division"

		- if the rule exists then the following two processes 
		  Set Overall-Place By Division,

		- if the rule does NOT exist, then they 
		  Set Overall-Place By Place

		- "Calculate Over All Place"
		- "Calculate Net-Performance; Percentile; World-Standard; Points"

		- please check these two processes still work as required.


	- Processing now no longer tries to be smart, before it was auto selecting
	  the "Set Overall-Place" by looking at the EventType.

	- You will now need to set the correct rule for each series, as you
	  cannot choose it from the processing menu.

	- To help you set up the correct rules, this is how I was previously
	  selecting the "Set Overall-Place":

		- Jump or Throw 
			"Set Overall-Place By Division"

		- Long Distance 
			"Set Overall-Place By Division"

		- Sprint 
			"Set Overall-Place By Place"
