Build	2444
Release	267

	changes are:

	- many small changes.

	- title now displays orgname on all pages instead of just webAthletics

	- Security Menu - now auto generates Security Permission Tables, instead of
		letting you modify it manually.  ie creating a table that is not supported
		in the webAthl.DLL would have no effect anyway.

	- database error messages now set at a global level, very easy to chnage messages
		now.  I chnaged the "Error, updateing the database" message to
		"Database Unchanged"

	- cleaned up html, removed unessary colspan=1 and other things.

	- removed [dbo]. from recordsets (internal)

	- new function for displayAccessDeniedPage (internal) -> cleaned up alot of 
		unecessary duplicated code.

	- Report Event Tally now allows Tally count from FirstEventForSeason as well as
		all events.

	- Options Appearance color codes now need a # in front.  by doing it this way
		you can also type in color names, eg
		color code "GOLD" is the same as "#FFD700"
		CORNFLOWER == #6495ED
		CHOCOLATE == #D2691E ...
		you can look up these color codes in the MSDN library - Color Table.

	- Exit URL button now implemented.
		- the button will be invisable until you name an exiturl in thr options

	- Cascading Style Sheets now supported in Options menu.


		- note that the last 3 required a registry change.
		- this means that SHERPA will reset all registry values to their default
		  at first run-time. ie any global appearance settings will be reset.

	- Database change to Options table to support StyleSheet column.

		- do a database Backup with old DLL
		- edit the options CSV in excel to put an extra blank column at the end.
		- change all color codes to have # in front. eg #F2F2F2.
		- do a database Restore with new DLL

		- don't forget to change all 3 : ACTVAC, ACTCCC AND testACTVAC databases.
	

	- I have changed my mind again with your SHERPA link on your ACTVAC menu frame
		- get rid of the button and go back to the normal html link
		- the reason I wanted the button in a new window was for 2 reasons
			- 1 stop people using the BACK button and insetad navigate with the
				sherpa buttons
			- 2 the exit url button was going to a window close button instead.
				- this required javascript inside SHERPA which i don't want

		- so I have gone back to plan A, with a specified exit URL link.
			- which means that the link will be opened in the current window.
			- so we need to have the window as a normal browser.
