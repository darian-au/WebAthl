Build	3708
Release	344

	changes are:

	- Report -> Age Group Ranking, added rank column, select series first.

	- New Report -> Series Statistics

		- calculates totals, uses SQL to count the data, so even for
		  Thomas Series it adds up 20,000 rows in split second.

	- Modified all other reports to use Bitmask for display options, works
	  a lot better, and easier to maintain.
