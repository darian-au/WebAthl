Build	2725
Release	287

	changes are:

	- Reports -> Roster
		- Now allows selection of columns for display, as well as order by selection.
		- Security Permission to "ViewPerson", allows selection of all Person columns,
			otherwise, selection of minimal details, try it by logging in as "guest"

	- All references to PartnerID are now replaced with ContactID
		- there was still some spots I missed

	- Database structure unchanged but Person.PartnerID changed to Person.ContactID
		- this change requires a data reload, i.e,
			- backup with old webAthl.dll for each database, then
			- restore with new webAthl.dll for each database.
