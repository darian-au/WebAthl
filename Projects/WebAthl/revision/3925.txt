Build	3925
Release	353

	changes are:

	- Removed AgeCategory and Handicapped Columns from Series table.
		- You need to do a Backup, Create Tables, Restore to rebuild the
		  database.
		- But before you do the restore, you must modify the Series.CSV file
		  to remove the AgeCategory and Hadicapped Columns.


	- pEx->Delete(); added in all catch blocks.


	- Registered/Shareware Version,
		- Shareware version is now limited to:
			-  1 Series,
			- 10 Events on each Series,
			- 50 Persons.

		- Message :
			Maximum <tbl> Count Reached.  Please Purchase a License Key.

		- The Message appears when:
			- Adding a new Series,
			- Adding a new Event on a Series,
			- Adding a new Person,
			- Processing.

		- We cant stop people from manually loading data into the database,
		  so I put the restriction on Processing also.  So even if they
		  manage to get the data in, they cant do anything with it.
