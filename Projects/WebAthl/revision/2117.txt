Release	233

	changes are:

	- Auto Allocate SecuritySeries if user 'adds' a Series
	- Sort Order on GroupsAlpha report
	- Rules Report
		- you may notice "Incomplete Rule" on some series
		- this comes from adding a rule to the rules but not saving it.
		- eg. Cross Country Championships, you added a rule but wanted to keep them as 0
			so you didn't save it.  you must save the rule regardless.

	- Processing Lockout is now seperate.
		- Rules for processing are as follows:

			- An Event can be Pre-Event Processed if:
				1. Participant count in PreResults Table is 0 for the event
				2. Participant count in PostResults Table is 0 for the event
				i.e no results have been entered anywhere for the event

			- An Event can be Post-Event Processind if:
				1. Participant count in PostResults Table is > 0 for the event

			- An Event can be Locked-Out if:
				1. Participant count in PostResults Table is > 0 for the event
				2. Participant count in PostResults Table is = Participant 
				   count in Results Table for the event.
				i.e the event has been Post-Event Processed at least once.
